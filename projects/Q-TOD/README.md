## Overview

**Q-TOD** is a novel **Q**uery-driven **T**ask-**O**riented **D**ialogue system, which consists of three sequential modules: query generator, knowledge retriever, and response generator.

* Query generator extracts the essential information from the dialogue context into a concise query in an unstructured format of the natural language.
* Knowledge retriever is an off-the-shelf retrieval model, which utilizes the generated query to retrieve relevant knowledge records.
* Response generator produces a system response based on the retrieved knowledge records and the dialogue context.

## Usage

### Preparation

Prepare models and datasets.
```bash
bash ./prepare.sh
```
It downloads six fine-tuned models to `./models`:
* [Q-TOD_T5-Large_SMD](https://dialogue.bj.bcebos.com/Knover/projects/Q-TOD/Q-TOD_T5-Large_SMD.tar): the pre-trained T5-Large is fine-tuned with the SMD.
* [Q-TOD_T5-Large_CamRest](https://dialogue.bj.bcebos.com/Knover/projects/Q-TOD/Q-TOD_T5-Large_CamRest.tar): the pre-trained T5-Large is fine-tuned with the CamRest.
* [Q-TOD_T5-Large_MultiWOZ](https://dialogue.bj.bcebos.com/Knover/projects/Q-TOD/Q-TOD_T5-Large_MultiWOZ.tar): the pre-trained T5-Large is fine-tuned with the MultiWOZ.
* [Q-TOD_T5-3B_SMD](https://dialogue.bj.bcebos.com/Knover/projects/Q-TOD/Q-TOD_T5-3B_SMD.tar): the pre-trained T5-3B is fine-tuned with the SMD.
* [Q-TOD_T5-3B_CamRest](https://dialogue.bj.bcebos.com/Knover/projects/Q-TOD/Q-TOD_T5-3B_CamRest.tar): the pre-trained T5-3B is fine-tuned with the CamRest.
* [Q-TOD_T5-3B_MultiWOZ](https://dialogue.bj.bcebos.com/Knover/projects/Q-TOD/Q-TOD_T5-3B_MultiWOZ.tar): the pre-trained T5-3B is fine-tuned with the MultiWOZ.

It also downloads SMD, CamRest and MultiWOZ under the `./data`.

### Inference and Evaluation

Use fine-tuned model to infer and evaluate the test set.
```bash
bash ./infer.sh
```
After inference and evaluation, you can find results of inference and evaluation score in `./output`.
